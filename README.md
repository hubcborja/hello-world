# hello-world
My first repository


I'm capable of acting and making decisions weighing the information at my disposal. In addition, my experience as professor assistant and intern has given me the opportunity to develop my communicative skills and confidence about my work. I can identify and answer to the feelings and necessities of the people around me. I have skills in programming in R, Python and Stata.

I love :pizza: and :coffee:
